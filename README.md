# Overview

This repository will contain projects that I have done and I want to do. The projects that will be added here are different programming languages to showcase the skills I learned throughout my learning as a Software Engineer.

This repository in particular is my portfolio page that will showcase all of the projects I make and will make.

The purpose of creating this web application is so that it is easier for hiring managers and other people to see my projects since it will all be in one place.
